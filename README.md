# Calculator
This is an open source android Calculator app. 

Currently it still has a few bugs:
- Have yet to account for division by zero leading to Arithmetic Exception at CalManager
- The cancel button doesn't correctly delete when it is with an exponential number

The android app is already published at Google Play store and I am working towards fixing all the bugs and introducing new 
features to the app. It is very much maintained by me right now.

I welcome everyone to contribute to it. Just do a pull request and I will review the proposed changes asap.
